# Considering the numerical values of the grades explained in Exercise 2,
# create a program that translates a number between 0 and 4 into the nearest literal grade.
# For example, the number 2.8 (which could be the average of several grades) must be translated as Bâ€“.
# Solve the tie cases in favor of the best grade: for example, 2.85 must be translated as B.
